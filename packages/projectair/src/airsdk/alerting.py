"""Local, real-time alerting over a growing AgDR chain (free tier).

:class:`LocalAlerter` is the reusable core behind ``air watch``: it runs the
detectors over the records captured so far and returns only the findings it has
not surfaced before, deduplicated by ``(detector_id, step_index)`` so a growing,
append-only chain never re-alerts the same finding.

The same core is intended to later back the recorder hook and hosted cloud
delivery, so the alerting logic lives in exactly one place. This module performs
no I/O and prints nothing; callers (e.g. the ``air watch`` CLI) decide how to
deliver an alert.
