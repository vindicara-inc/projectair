"""Issue Ed25519-signed Vindicara Pro license tokens.

The signing side mirrors ``packages/projectair-pro/tools/issue_license.py``;
this module exists so the FastAPI Lambda can call ``issue_license_token`` in
process and load the private key from a string (env var or Secrets Manager
fetch) rather than a filesystem path.

Every token produced here verifies with ``airsdk_pro.license.verify_token``
on the customer side because both halves use the same canonicalization
(sorted keys, no whitespace, UTF-8) and the same Ed25519 keypair.
